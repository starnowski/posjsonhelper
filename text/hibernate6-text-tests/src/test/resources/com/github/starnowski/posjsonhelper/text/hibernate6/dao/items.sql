The aluminium backplate option yields lower weight for travel use, while the 3D mesh padding on harness and backplate enhances comfort and stability. The wing is a double-shell toroidal (“donut”) style providing balanced trim and buoyancy control, and the modular system allows flexible weight distribution for warm or cold water use. The harness features ITW Nexus QR buckles, and the system is adjustable to diverse body shapes. (Dry BCD weight ~1.05 kg; full set without weight pockets ~3.5 kg) ',
